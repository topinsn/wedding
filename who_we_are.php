                    Our wedding videos capture your big day on film to let you relive it time and time again. Plus, they help loved ones who couldn’t be with you feel like they were there on the day. <br><br> I have been capturing dream days on film since
                    2006, and after being the wedding videographer at over 300 beautiful weddings, I still take the responsibility to capture your precious moments seriously, resulting in stunningly heartfelt videos. I always believe that hiring a local
                    wedding videographer is more than just hiring someone to carry a camera.

                    I consider it a tremendous honor. My videos have a natural feel to them, yet with an artistic and cinematic touch. My objective is to blend in with the wedding party without being noticed. That way, I can capture everyone exactly as
                    they are in the moment. I make sure that everyone is at ease and forgets that there is a video camera in the room. Nothing surpasses the pleasure I get when I read the great remarks from my happy couples after they've viewed and savored
                    their special day on film, even after all these years.

                    right. I also know that to be the best wedding videographer, I need to get to know you both as a couple and find out about your unique relationship. I find that one of the main elements that sets me apart from other people is that
                    I want to get to know the couples I film for.

                Adedamola was responsive from the start; we met with him to discuss our needs and felt straight away that he was the perfect pick. He was pleasant and professional. We had no idea he was there that day and he captured so many things without our knowledge.
                Adedamola stayed till the wee hours of the morning. What he captured and put together for us astounded us. I would have been content with just the highlights from the brief film he made. I honestly believe we could not have picked a finer
                photographer to document our wonderful day. Not only did we have a fantastic day, but we've also become friends. I can't say enough good things about him.
